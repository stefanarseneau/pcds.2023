    "Actors are stateful workers in Ray. The Ray docoumentation refers to these as \"service centers\".\n",
    "We will use actors to reimplement the Game of Life program (that we did in Dask). This will be a BSP-like program with two (implicit) barriers. They are implicit becaue there is no class/object that is the barrier. The barrier is achieved by waiting on all functions to complete in all Ray actors before submitting the next functions.  The pseuocode is something like:\n",
    "  1. Startup\n",
    "        * create a 2x2 array of remote actors and intialize local grids (8x8) plus overlapping ghost cells on each actor.\n",
    "            * place a glider in the (0,0) actor\n",
    "        * having created actors, initialize the neighbors (ray oids) in each actor.\n",
    "  2. Launch remote asynchronous functions on each actor to update the local gird\n",
    "  3. Await computation to complete (barrier)\n",

    "### Actors: The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "An actor is associated with a decorated `@ray.remote` class. When you define an actor, you get a runtime handle (object identifier) to the actor. That handle provides access to all methods and state within the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the methods within the class are `remote()`. You should think of this as\n",
    "  * the actor is assigned to a compute resource \n",
    "  * function calls package arguments (and other needed state) and ships it to the remote resource\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with actors, you should try to have your remote calls be as minimal as possible and keep state within the actor at all times. I.e., try not to send a lot of state across actors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So here is the class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "NB--I implemented this in PyCharm and moved it over. It's too complicated a piece of code for Jupyter. I needed a lot of debugging support.\n",
